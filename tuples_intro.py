# tuple data struture
# tuple can store any data type
# most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update
# data inside tuple
 
example = ('one', 'two', 'three')
# no append, no insert, no pop, no remove
# days = ('monday', 'tuesday')
# tuples are faster than lists

# # methods 
# count, index
# len function
# slicing tuple[]

print(example[:2])
